"""Tests for the negamax module, comparing its output to
the minimax module on curated positions.

These tests cover the following features:
- Negamax suggestion: Testing that the negamax_suggestion function returns
  the same move, principal variation, and evaluation as the minimax_suggestion
  function on a variety of game states and search depths.

The tests use pytest for assertions and parameterization.
Each test includes a docstring that describes the feature being tested,
the scenario, and the expected outcomes."""
