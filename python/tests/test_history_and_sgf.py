"""Tests for the history and SGF functionality of the four_in_a_row package.
These tests cover the following features:

- HistoryManager: Testing the undo and replay functionality of
  the HistoryManager class.
- SGF import/export: Testing the export_sgf and import_sgf functions for
  correct serialization and deserialization of game states, as well as
  error handling for invalid SGF content.

The tests use pytest for assertions and exception handling. Each test includes
a docstring that describes the feature being tested, the scenario, and the
expected outcomes.
