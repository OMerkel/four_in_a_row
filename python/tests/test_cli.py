"""Tests for the command-line interface (CLI) of the Four in a Row game.
These tests simulate user interactions with the CLI by
providing predefined command sequences and capturing the outputs.
The tests cover various scenarios, including:
- Quitting immediately
- Requesting suggestions from different engines
- Playing against an engine and undoing moves
- Saving and loading game states
- Handling invalid commands and arguments
Each test verifies that the CLI responds correctly to the given commands
and that the outputs contain the expected information.
